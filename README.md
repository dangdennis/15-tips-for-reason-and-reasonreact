# 15 Tips for Learning Reason & ReasonReact

1. Filenames are component names capitalized, and name their modules.
2. You dont need to import modules!
3. Converting between different Reason data types.
4. Don't forget to convert Reason data types to their corresponding React elements, with `ReasonReact.string`, `ReasonReact.array`, or `ReasonReact.null`.
5. Passing props, and the use of `~` and `_` with argument names
6. Use variants and pattern matching!
7. Map, filter, and reduce in Reason
8. Style with CSS stylesheet or inline.
9. Bucklescript's Belt module provides us a more Javascript-like standard library.
10. Curly braces, or blocks, automatically return the last expression.
11. Stateful components: define state and action
12. All functions in Reason are curried, that’s why piping works in Reason, and why List.map has the primary parameter at the end, and the higher order function the first parameter position
13. Pipe `|>` vs Fast pipe `->`
