# 20 Tips for Learning ReasonReact


1. Filenames are component names capitalized, and name their modules.
2. You dont need to import modules! 
3. Converting between different Reason data types.
4. Don't forget to convert Reason data types to their corresponding React elements, with `ReasonReact.string`, `ReasonReact.array`, or `ReasonReact.null`.
5. Map, filter, and reduce in Reason
6. Use a list. Map list to array. Map array to React elements.
7. Style with CSS stylesheet or inline.
8. What the heck is `Open`?
9.  Passing props, and the use of `~` and `_` with argument names
10. Curly braces, or blocks, automatically return the last expression.
11. Stateful components: define state and action
12. All functions in Reason are curried, that’s why piping works in Reason, and why List.map has the primary parameter at the end, and the higher order function the first parameter position
13. `|>` vs `->`
